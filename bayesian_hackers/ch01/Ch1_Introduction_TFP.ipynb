    ">You are a skilled programmer, but bugs still slip into your code. After a particularly difficult implementation of an algorithm, you decide to test your code on a trivial example. It passes. You test the code on a harder problem. It passes once again. And it passes the next, even more difficult, test too! You are starting to believe that there may be no bugs in this code...\n",

    "If you think this way, then congratulations, you already are thinking Bayesian! Bayesian inference is simply updating your beliefs after considering new evidence. A Bayesian can rarely be certain about a result, but he or she can be very confident. Just like in the example above, we can never be 100% sure that our code is bug-free unless we test it on every possible problem; something rarely possible in practice. Instead, we can test it on a large number of problems, and if it succeeds we can feel more confident about our code, but still not certain. Bayesian inference works identically: we update our beliefs about an outcome; rarely can we be absolutely sure unless we rule out all other alternatives.\n",

In practice, many probabilistic programming systems will cleverly interleave these forward and backward operations to efficiently home in on the best explanations.\n",

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that Bayesian methodology returns a *distribution*. Hence we now have distributions to describe the unknown $\\lambda$s and $\\tau$. What have we gained? Immediately, we can see the uncertainty in our estimates: the wider the distribution, the less certain our posterior belief should be. We can also see what the plausible values for the parameters are: $\\lambda_1$ is around 18 and $\\lambda_2$ is around 23. The posterior distributions of the two $\\lambda$s are clearly distinct, indicating that it is indeed likely that there was a change in the user's text-message behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "What other observations can you make? If you look at the original data again, do these results seem reasonable? \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also that the posterior distributions for the $\\lambda$s do not look like exponential distributions, even though our priors for these variables were exponential. In fact, the posterior distributions are not really of any form that we recognize from the original model. But that's OK! This is one of the benefits of taking a computational point of view. If we had instead done this analysis using mathematical approaches, we would have been stuck with an analytically intractable (and messy) distribution. Our use of a computational approach makes us indifferent to mathematical tractability.\n",
    " \n",
    "Our analysis also returned a distribution for $\\tau$. Its posterior distribution looks a little different from the other two because it is a discrete random variable, so it doesn't assign probabilities to intervals. We can see that near day 45, there was a 50% chance that the user's behaviour changed. Had no change occurred, or had the change been gradual over time, the posterior distribution of $\\tau$ would have been more spread out, reflecting that many days were plausible candidates for $\\tau$. By contrast, in the actual results we see that only three or four days make any sense as potential transition points. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why would I want samples from the posterior, anyways?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will deal with this question for the remainder of the book, and it is an understatement to say that it will lead us to some amazing results. For now, let's end this chapter with one more example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the posterior samples to answer the following question: what is the expected number of texts at day $t, \\; 0 \\le t \\le 70$ ? Recall that the expected value of a Poisson variable is equal to its parameter $\\lambda$. Therefore, the question is equivalent to *what is the expected value of $\\lambda$ at time $t$*?\n",
    " \n",
    "In the code below, let $i$ index samples from the posterior distributions. Given a day $t$, we average over all possible $\\lambda_i$ for that day $t$, using $\\lambda_i = \\lambda_{1,i}$ if $t \\lt \\tau_i$ (that is, if the behaviour change has not yet occurred), else we use $\\lambda_i = \\lambda_{2,i}$. \n"

We can speculate what might have caused this: a cheaper text-message rate, a recent weather-to-text subscription, or perhaps a new relationship.
